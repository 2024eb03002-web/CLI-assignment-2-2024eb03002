Question 10 [6 Points]

Write a C program demonstrating signal handling.
• Parent process runs indefinitely

• Child process sends SIGTERM after 5 seconds

• Another child sends SIGINT after 10 seconds

• Parent handles each signal differently and exits gracefully


i first created a signals.c file using nano command.  

command 

      signal(SIGTERM, handler)

explanation:- registers a user defined function handler() to be executed automatically when the process receives the sigterm signal instead of terminating immediately.

command 

			signal(SIGNIT, handler)

explanation:- Associates the SIGNIT signal(generated by ctrl+c) with the same handler function, allowing proper handling of user interrupts. 

command 

	    fork()

creates a new child process. The parent and the child run concurrently(at the same time basically). The return value does distinguish parent and child execution paths.

command 

		  sleep(n)

explanation:- suspends execution of the calling process for n seconds. I used it here to delay signal sending so that i can observe the behavior.

command 

	    kill(getppid(), SIGTERM)

explanation:- sends a signal (SIGTERM) to the parent process by obtaining its process ID using getppid().

command 

	    pause()

explanation:- suspends the parent process until any signal is received.

executed the file + output
executed the file through compiling the file with the command 

    gcc signals.c -o signals

output received was 

    SIGTERM received

indicating the file has executed properly.
